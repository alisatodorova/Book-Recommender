**Title:** Comparison of Hybrid Book Recommender Systems: Matrix Factorization with Neural Networks vs. Neural Collaborative Filtering with Attention

**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore two advanced hybrid models for book recommendation systems: Matrix Factorization with Neural Networks (MF-NN) and Neural Collaborative Filtering with Attention (NCF-Attention). The goal of this research is to enhance prediction accuracy and generalization by leveraging deep learning techniques alongside traditional collaborative filtering methods. Our study employs the ”Book-Crossing: User review ratings” dataset from Kaggle to train, optimize, incrementally enhance, and then evaluate each of the models, focusing on their performance and scalability. Our findings indicate that while both models offer significant improvements over traditional approaches, the MF-NN model demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency for our given dataset.
